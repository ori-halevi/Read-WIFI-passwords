# WiFi Password Viewer

A Windows batch script that displays all saved WiFi network passwords on your computer.

## Description

This script retrieves and displays a list of all wireless networks that have ever been connected to your Windows computer, along with their saved passwords. It uses Windows built-in `NETSH` commands to extract this information.

## Features

- üì° Lists all saved WiFi networks
- üîë Displays passwords for each network
- üé® Color-coded output for better readability
- üîí Works with networks that have special characters in their names
- üíæ Uses temporary files for processing

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges (may be required for some networks)
- PowerShell (for colored output)

## Usage

1. **Download the script** to your computer
2. **Right-click** on the `.bat` file
3. **Select "Run as administrator"** (recommended for full access)
4. **View the results** - all networks and passwords will be displayed
5. **Press any key** to exit when done

## Output Format

The script displays information in the following format:

```
--- Wireless network name:-----> . . . . 'NetworkName'
--- Password:------------------> . . . . 'password123'
```

## How It Works

1. Uses `NETSH WLAN SHOW PROFILE` to list all saved WiFi profiles
2. For each profile, runs `NETSH WLAN SHOW PROFILE [name] KEY=CLEAR` to get the password
3. Parses the output to extract network names and passwords
4. Displays results with colored formatting using PowerShell
